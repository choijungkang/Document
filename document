\begin{abstract}
The background of developing applications on the theme of the relationship between sleep quality and brain waves contains important and meaningful elements in many ways. I will explain the background of developing an application that measures sleep quality by measuring brain waves and corrects sleep patterns based on this. Increased health problems and stress: In modern society, stress and various health problems are occurring on a daily basis. These problems are associated with poor sleep quality. Lack of sleep negatively affects physical and mental health, and it is important to recover your body and mind and relax through sleep. Advances in scientific research: In recent decades, sleep analysis through brain waves has developed significantly in the field of sleep research. Brainwave measurements can accurately determine sleep stages and quality, and this information plays an important role in understanding and improving individual sleep patterns. The importance of personalized healthcare: Personalized health care is being emphasized. Each individual has its own sleep patterns and requirements, and general rules are not enough. Therefore, you need an application that measures brain waves to tell you which type of sleep pattern is most ideal for an individual and provides advice accordingly. Technology Innovation and Utilization: Modern technology makes it relatively easy to measure and analyze brain waves, and this data can be collected through smartphones and wearable devices. These innovations require applications that enable users to easily collect sleep data and receive personalized health information. Promote a healthy lifestyle: Sleep care applications help promote healthy lifestyles for users. Improved sleep patterns can provide several benefits, including improved productivity, reduced stress, and improved immunity, which can lead to better quality of life.
Considering this background, developing an application that utilizes the relationship between sleep quality and brain waves is expected to play an important role in improving personal health and well-being. Users will have the tools to better understand and improve their sleeping habits so they can enjoy healthier and more prosperous lives.\\

Customer & YunSeo Jeong & She likes to enjoy SNS and communicate with people like any other person in their 20s. She suffers from insomnia these days. She's trying to relieve her insomnia herself. For that reason, she is writing a sleep diary to relieve insomnia. However, the existing sleep diary application was too restrict to record continuously. For keeping sleep diary steadly, she is looking for a sleep diary platform that is more fun and can communicate with people. \\\\

Through images created through his own brain waves during sleep, he was able to check his sleep state more intuitively, and was sometimes able to share his dreams with other friends which intrigued his friend. \\\\

Software developer & ByeongHeon Kang & First, a software developer accurately comprehends the project requirements, identifies user needs, and provides a sense of direction for the software. This leads to the development of technical specifications and system architecture. This design phase determines the fundamental structure of the software, serving as a blueprint for its implementation. Next, the developer embarks on the actual coding and development work. In this phase, they adhere to technical specifications, writing source code and implementing various features and functionalities. Ensuring code quality and performance is crucial, and the developer performs testing and debugging to resolve errors and bugs. Effective communication about project progress and challenges is necessary. This facilitates alignment among all team members and is pivotal for the successful development of the software.\\\\

This demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE Computer Society conference papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
